# Enterprise Network Lab using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of an enterprise-style network using:
- VLAN segmentation
- Inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
- DHCP automation
- ACL security
- SSH remote management
- Static routing
- NAT for WAN access

All configurations were implemented and tested in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Network Topology

The following diagram represents the full network topology, including VLAN segments, trunk links, routers, switches, and the WAN connection.
